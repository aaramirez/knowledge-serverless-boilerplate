At Knowledge we leverage AWS Serverless technology to build highly scalable software in a micro-service fashion with less operational work, this allow us to focus on building great services and not worry about maintaining, scaling and provisioning servers; and we don't pay for idle capacity, which is great!.

We focus on security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization and operational excellence. This is our boilerplate for AWS Lambda Node.js Services using Serverless Framework. The infrastructure (VPCs) are managed separately with CloudFormation and backend developers have full ownership of the services, automated testing and deployment is done with Jenkins. We use mainly Node.js.

If you are new to Serverless Architectures in AWS we suggest you to read the the official 2017 AWS whitepaper on [Serverless Architectures
with AWS Lambda - Overview and Best Practices](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/serverless-architectures-with-aws-lambda.pdf) and [The AWS Well-Architected Framework](http://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf) will help you understand the pros and cons
of decisions you make while building systems on AWS.
